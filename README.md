I made a code for a little calculator, wich can make the four basic types of calculation.

Function 1  add
    For the addition of 2 numbers

Function 2 sub
    For the subtraction of 2 numbers

Function 3 mult
    For the multiplication of 2 numbers

Function 4 div
    For the division of 2 numbers

Function 5 call_func
    This function makes the request of the operation and will start function 1-4 or will print error by false input.
